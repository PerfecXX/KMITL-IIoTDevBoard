###MicroPython Firmware
---
MicroPython is not flashed onto the ESP32 or ESP8266 boards by default. The first thing you need to do to start programming your boards with MicroPython is upload the firmware.

### Download ESP32 MicroPython Firmware
---
1. Go to the ESP32 MicroPython Downloads page: [https://micropython.org/download/esp32/](https://micropython.org/download/esp32/)

2. Scroll your mouse to the very bottom of the web then you should see `Firmware (Compiled with IDF 3.x)`.

3. Select the lastest release to download `.bin` files. 

4. The firmware (.bin) should be downloaded. 

### Download and Installing USB Driver. 
---
Before you connect the Micro USB to your computer, you should install the USB Driver first, otherwise Thonny might not find your USB port.

The driver is different depending on the chip on the ESP32. 
But the most ESP32 use CP210x USB to UART Bridge VCP Drivers.
Click [here](https://www.silabs.com/developers/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers "here") to nevigate to the download page.

For Windows, select `CP210x Windows Drivers`, then the driver should start downloading. 
For Mac OSX, the driver should be built in with the OS, so there is no need to download it.

(If you do not see the MicroPython Device window, click the `view` menu on the top, then on the dropdown select the `File` menu. The window should appear.)
### Testing your MicroPython 
---
1. Click the `New` menu on the top (or Ctrl+N) to create a new file, then save it as `main.py` (if you want to deploy or upload to ESP32, otherwise the code will not work).
2. After that, in the editor coppy the following code.
